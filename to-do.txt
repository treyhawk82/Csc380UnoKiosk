What's missing?
- timeout function
- synchronization
- limiting connections
- after a victory when the game resets, it then starts with player yellow / 1 instead of blue / 0 for some unknown reason
- merge the play() and checkHandForPlayableCard() methods at some point, see comment on that
- AI calls and calls out uno only in their turn - maybe change that later (low prio)
- Updated Documentation of artifacts(85% Done)
- TBC
