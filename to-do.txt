What's missing?
- draw 2 logic
- wild draw 4 logic
- victory screen of some sort, CATS?
- swap from AI to player
	- Player class that accepts a String from the server on which card has been played and which colour has been selected
- comments, I'm sorry :^)
- the special effect of the first card on the discard pile is currently not considered
- merge the play() and checkHandForPlayableCard() methods at some point, see comment on that
- TBC
