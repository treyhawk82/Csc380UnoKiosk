What's missing?
- //uno callout logic is there, just has to be hooked up with client
- currently the deck can run out of cards resulting in an exception, maybe check that in the dealCard() or whereever and rebase the deck
- after a victory when the game resets, it then starts with player yellow / 1 instead of blue / 0 for some unknown reason
- victory screen of some sort, CATS?
- swap from AI to player
	- Player class that accepts a String from the server on which card has been played and which colour has been selected
- comments, I'm sorry :^)
- the special effect of the first card on the discard pile is currently not considered
- merge the play() and checkHandForPlayableCard() methods at some point, see comment on that
- AI calls and calls out uno only in their turn - maybe change that later (low prio)
- Updated Documentation of artifacts(20% Done)
- TBC
